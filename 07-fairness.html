<h1>Data-driven decision making</h1>
<p>To avoid arbitrary decisions, <em>institutional decision making</em> has long been formalized via <em>bureaucratic</em> procedures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bureaucracy arose in part <em>as a response to the subjectivity, arbitrariness, and inconsistency</em> of human decision making.</li>
<li>Institutionalized rules and procedures aim to minimize the effects of humans’ frailties as individual decision makers [52].
<ul>
<li><em>Procedural protections</em> ensure that decisions are made transparently, on the basis of the <em>right and relevant information</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The fully developed bureaucratic apparatus compares with other organisations exactly as does the machine with the non-mechanical modes of production.</p>
<p>Max Weber <span class="citation" data-cites="waters2015weber">(<a href="#/references" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Waters et al. 2015</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weber’s <em>ideal-typical bureaucracy</em> is characterized by several factors, including</p>
<ul>
<li><em>all decisions</em> and powers <em>specified and restricted by regulations</em></li>
<li><em>officials with expert training</em> in their fields</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: which role can ML play in decision making?</p>

<section id="machine-learning" class="title-slide slide level1 center">
<h1>Machine learning</h1>
<p>Do humans always take optimal decisions?</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>A body of research <em>compared the accuracy of statistical models to the judgments of humans</em>, even with years of experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>In many head-to-head comparisons, <em>data-driven decisions are more accurate than those based on intuition or expertise</em>.</li>
<li>A 2002 study shows that <strong>automated</strong> underwriting of loans was both more accurate and less racially disparate.
<ul>
<li>These results have been welcomed as a way to ensure that high-stakes decisions that shape our lifes are <em>accurate</em> and <em>fair</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Entire disciplines have embraced mathematical models of optimal decision making</em> in their theoretical foundations.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can label deviations from mathematical optimality as “bias” that requires attention.</li>

<p>Which factors (<em>among all that we have observed</em>) bear a statistical relationship to the outcome?</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning</strong> adds a repertoire of heuristics that <em>learns decision rules from sufficiently large datasets</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Techniques for fitting huge statistical models on large datasets have led to impressive achievements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ML is a way to learn and make decisions about individuals directly from the data</strong>.</p>

<p>Interrogating ML is a way of interrogating institutional decision making in society today and for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<p><em>Learning</em> is not a process of simply committing examples to memory.</p>

<li><em>Induction</em>: drawing rules (from past examples) that effectively account for past cases, but that also apply to new/unseen cases.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Homing in on those details that are characteristic of “2” in general, not just the “2”s that appear in the examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When learning, ML turns <em>data into a model</em> that</p>
<ul>
<li>summarizes the patterns in the training data; <em>it makes generalizations</em>.</li>
<li>could take many forms: a hyperplane, or a set of distributions, a set of weights, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are reasons to be <em>cautiously optimistic about fairness and ML</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data-driven decision making has the potential to be more transparent compared to human decision making.</li>
<li>It forces to articulate our decision-making objectives and enables to clearly understand the trade-offs between desiderata.</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the interpretability and explainability of ML methods.</li>
<li>Proprietary nature of datasets and systems that are crucial to an informed public debate on this topic.</li>

<section id="machine-learning-3" class="title-slide slide level1 center">
<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<p>Supervised ML (e.g., <em>classification</em>) is a form of inductive reasoning.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Draw general rules from individual examples</em>, identifying the features and values that co-occur with an outcome of interest.</li>
<li>However, <em>insufficiently-individualized decisions are an unavoidable</em> part of inductive reasoning.
<ul>
<li>“Statistically sound but nonuniversal generalizations”: an individual fulfills all the criteria for inclusion in a particular group but fails to possess the quality that these criteria are expected to predict [82].</li>
<li>Even if we accept that decisions can never be fully individualized, we might still expect that decision makers take into account the full range of relevant information at their potential disposal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A car insurance company had an obligation to consider the applicants’ driving skills, not just the model and color of their car, even if doing so still meant that they were being assessed according to how often other people with similar driving skills Collecting and considering all of this information can be expensive, intrusive, and impractical. In fact, the cost of doing so could easily outweigh the perceived benefits that come from more granular decision making—not just to the decision maker but to the subjects of the decisions as well. For instance, if developing a much more detailed assessment of applicants for car insurance increases the operating costs of the insurer, the insurer is likely to charge applicants a higher price to offset these additional costs.</p>

<section id="machine-learning-classification" class="title-slide slide level1 center">
<h1>Machine Learning: Classification</h1>
<p><strong>Classification</strong> is possible due to patterns that connect the outcome of interest in a population to features we can observe.</p>
<p>We formalize classification in two steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Represent a population as a probability distribution.</li>
<li>Apply statistics, specifically statistical decision theory, to the probability distribution that represents the population.</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of classification is to determine a plausible value for an unknown target <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given observed covariates <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Covariates are represented as an an array of continuous or discrete variables, while the target is a discrete, often binary, value.</li>
<li>The covariates X and target Y are jointly distributed random variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of classification, the value <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> of the target variable is unknown</p>
<ul>
<li>We observe the covariates <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and make a guess <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y} = f(X)\)</span> based on what we observed.</li>
<li>The function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that maps our covariates into our guess <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span> is called a classifier, or predictor.</li>
<li>The output of the classifier is called label or prediction.</li>
<li>The performance of the classifier is usually measured in terms of <em>accuracy</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A classifier that always predicts no traffic fatality in the next year might have high accuracy on any given individual, simply because fatal accidents are unlikely. However, it’s a constant function that has no value in assessing the risk of a traffic fatality.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>

<section id="machine-learning-classification-1" class="title-slide slide level1 center">
<h1>Machine Learning: Classification</h1>
<p>In many classification tasks, the features <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> implicitly or explicitly encode an individual’s status in a protected category.</p>
<ul>
<li>The letter <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq X\)</span> (sensitive attribute) designates a discrete random variable that captures one or multiple sensitive characteristics.</li>
<li>Different settings of the random variable A correspond to different mutually disjoint groups of the population.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We can always represent any number of discrete protected categories as a single discrete attribute whose support corresponds to each of the possible settings of the original attributes. Consequently, our formal treatment in this chapter does apply to the case of multiple protected categories. This formal maneuver, however, does not address the important concept of intersectionality, which refers to the particular forms of disadvantage that members of multiple protected categories may experience [105].</p>

<p>Discussions of <em>discrimination</em> in ML seem odd since ML aims to differentiate between individuals—to discriminate between them.</p>
<p>However, discrimination here refers to treatment that systematically disadvantages one social group over others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain groups face barriers to entering some occupations, often due to perceptions of unfitness despite true capabilities.</li>
<li>Personal characteristics may structure society, excluding specific groups from opportunities systematically.
<ul>
<li>Race and gender are prominent because they have perpetuated systemic disadvantages.</li>
<li>These traits can underpin strict social hierarchies, assigning groups to more or less desirable societal positions.</li>
<li>Such conditions may create a caste-like system [141], confining certain groups to lasting disadvantage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Children are often assumed to belong to the same racial group as their biological parents, making the relative disadvantage that people may experience due to their race especially systematic: children born into families that have been unfairly deprived of resources and opportunities will have less access to these resources and opportunities, thereby limiting from the start of their lives how effectively they might realize their potential.</p>

<h1>Fairness in Machine Learning</h1>
<p>When we learn a model from data, are disparities preserved, mitigated, or exacerbated?</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, we should expect our models to faithfully reflect disparities found in the input data.
<ul>
<li>However, some patterns in the training data are knowledge that we wish to mine (smoking is associated with cancer),</li>
<li>… while others (girls like pink and boys like blue) represent stereotypes that we might wish to avoid learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learning algorithms have no general way to distinguish between these two types of patterns
<ul>
<li>Some patterns are the result of social norms and moral judgments.</li>
<li>Absent specific intervention, ML will extract stereotypes in the same way that it extracts knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Another common reason why ML might perform worse for some groups than others is sample size disparity.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we uniformly sample the training data, then by definition we’ll have fewer data points about minorities.</li>
<li>A “5 percent error” statistic might hide the fact that a model performs terribly for a minority group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning tend to generalize based on the majority culture, leading to a high error rate for minority groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempting to avoid this by making the model more complex runs into a different problem: overfitting.</li>

<h1>Metrics for fairness: Independence</h1>
<p>When applied to a binary classifier <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y} \in \{0, 1\}\)</span>, <em>independence</em> is often referred to as demographic parity or group fairness.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P\{\hat{Y}=1|A=a\}=P\{\hat{Y}=1|A=b\}\)</span></li>
<li>We can determine if acceptance rates are equal in the two groups by knowing the three probabilities <span class="math inline">\(P\{\hat{Y} = 1, A = a\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\{\hat{Y} = 1, A = b\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(P\{A = a\}\)</span> that fully specify the joint distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A relaxation of the constraint is the following</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P\{\hat{Y}=1|A=a\} \ge P\{\hat{Y}=1|A=b\} - \epsilon\)</span> which transforms into <span class="math inline">\(\frac{P\{\hat{Y}=1|A=a\}}{P\{\hat{Y}=1|A=b\}} \ge 1 - \epsilon\)</span>

In group <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, the company hires carelessly selected applicants at the same rate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Even though the acceptance rates in both groups are identical, it is far more likely that unqualified applicants are selected in one group than in the other. As a result, it will appear in hindsight that members of group <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> performed worse than members of group <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, thus establishing <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> negative track record for group <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is evident from the data is that gender seems to influence department choice.</li>
<li>Women and men appear to have different preferences for different fields of study.</li>
<li>Different departments have different admission criteria. Some have lower acceptance rates, some higher.</li>
<li>Therefore, one explanation for the data we see is that women chose to apply to more competitive departments, and hence were rejected at a higher rate than men.</li>
<li>The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system. [175]</li>

<h1>How to Test a Nondiscrimination Criterion?</h1>
<p><strong>Audit study</strong> is a popular technique for diagnosing discrimination in a <em>field</em> experiment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Field experiments study decision-making in real contexts, avoiding lab artifacts.</li>
<li>Carefully controlled experiments reveal treatment effects rather than mere correlations.</li>
<li>Experiments on real systems are challenging to execute.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most audit studies are best seen as attempts to test blindness: whether a decision maker directly uses a sensitive attribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The researchers recruited 38 testers to visit about 150 car dealerships to bargain for cars, and record the price they were offered at the end of bargaining [293]. Testers visited dealerships in pairs; testers in a pair differed in terms of race or gender. Both testers in a pair bargained for the same model of car, at the same dealership, usually within a few days of each other. The researchers went to great lengths to minimize any differences between the testers that might correlate with race or gender. In particular, all testers were between 28 and 32 years old, had 3 our 4 years of postsecondary education, and “were subjectively chosen to have average attractiveness.” Further, to minimize the risk of testers’ interaction with dealers being correlated with race or gender, every aspect of their verbal or nonverbal behavior was governed by a script. For example, all testers “wore similar ‘yuppie’ sportswear and drove to the dealership in similar rented cars.” They also had to memorize responses to a long list of questions they were likely to encounter. All of this required extensive training and regular debriefs. The paper’s main finding was a large and statistically significant price penalty in the offers received by Black testers. For example, Black males received final offers that were about $1,100 more than White males, which represents a threefold difference in dealer profits based on data about dealer costs.</p>

<p>A tempting interpretation of this study is that if two people were identical except for race, with one being White and the other being Black, then the offers they should expect to receive would differ by about $1,100.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another famous audit study by Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan tested discrimination in the labor market [295]. Instead of sending testers in person, the researchers sent in fictitious résumés in response to job ads. Their goal was to test if an applicant’s race had an impact on the likelihood of an employer inviting them for an interview. They signaled race in the résumés by using White-sounding names (Emily, Greg) or Black-sounding names (Lakisha, Jamal). White names were 50 percent more likely to result in a callback than Black names. The magnitude of the effect was equivalent to an additional eight years of experience on a résumé.</p>

<p>A study looked at decisions made by judges in Louisiana juvenile courts, including sentence lengths [304]. It found that in the week following an upset loss suffered by the Louisiana State University (LSU) football team, judges imposed sentences that were 7 percent longer on average. The impact was greater for Black defendants. The effect was driven entirely by judges who got their undergraduate degrees at LSU, suggesting that the effect is due to the emotional impact of the loss. For readers unfamiliar with the culture of college football in the United States, the paper helpfully notes that “Describing LSU football just as an event would be a huge understatement for the residents of the state of Louisiana”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A study tested the relationship between the order in which parole cases are heard by judges and the outcomes of those cases [305]. It found that the percentage of favorable rulings started out at about 65 percent early in the day before gradually dropping to nearly zero Right before the judges’ food break, returned to around 65 percent after the break, with the same pattern repeated for the following food break! The authors suggested that judges’ mental resources are depleted over the course of a session, leading to poorer decisions. It quickly became known as the “hungry judges” study and has been widely cited as an example of the fallibility of human decision makers (figure 7.1). A follow-up investigation revealed multiple confounders and potential confounders, including the fact that prisoners without an attorney are presented last within each session, and tend to prevail at a much lower rate [307]. This invalidates the conclusion of the original study.</p>

<p>Consider an algorithm employed by a health care system to predict which patients would benefit most from a “high-risk care management” program [81].

That’s because the developers adopted health care costs as the target of prediction, on the apparent belief that it would serve as a reasonable proxy for health care needs. The common recounting of this story suggests that decision makers simply failed to recognize the fact that there are racial disparities in both care seeking and the provision of health care that cause Black patients of equivalently poor health to be less expensive than non-Black patients.</p>

Nonetheless, it provides different opportunities to consumers at racially disparate rates. The concern is that this might contribute to the perpetuation of long-lasting cycles of inequality.

<p>If a user clicked on the first link on a page of search results, is that simply because it was first, or because it was in fact the most relevant? This is again a case of the action (the ordering of search results) affecting the outcome (the link(s) the user clicks on).</p>

<p>Bias in feedback might also reflect cultural prejudices, which are of course much harder to characterize.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 2016 paper by Kristian Lum and William Isaac analyzed a predictive policing algorithm by PredPol. This is one of the few predictive policing algorithms to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, for which the company deserves praise. By applying the algorithm to data derived from Oakland police records, the authors found that Black people would be targeted for predictive policing of drug crimes at roughly twice the rate of White people, even though the two groups have roughly equal rates of drug use [30]. Their simulation showed that this initial bias would be amplified by a feedback loop, with policing increasingly concentrated on targeted areas. This is despite the fact that the PredPol algorithm does not explicitly take demographics into account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laws in many US states limit the degree to which car insurance providers can take into account “extraordinary life circumstances” when making underwriting or pricing decisions.
