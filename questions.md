3 questions

1. historical evolution of machine learning
2. open set or closed set
3. draw the structure of an artificial neuron
4. how many classification functions? multicategorical cross entropy, binary crosentropy
5. ... and for the regression task what do we use as a loss function? RMSE (is a metric and a loss function), MSE and MAE, R2 is only a metric. Do you remember the equations?
6. sigmoid vs softmax function... we map digits into probabilities
7. backpropagation with gradient descent. Why is it important to use the gradient? Gradient relates the error and the GT, we follow the gradient to localize the minimums of the function
8. how can we represent images into computers? Images can be represented as matrixes. Black is 0 or 255? 0 represents the level of brightness. And then we have the brightness of red, green, blue. What are others space colors?
9. Main format of images. JPG and PNG. The main difference is the level of compression. JPS is lossy. PNG is lossless.
