# Table of Contents and Course Goals

Hands-on *machine learning* (Module 2, 24 hours)

- *Theory*, *practice*, and *case studies* of the main steps of the CRISP-DM methodology
  - We will have coding labs
  - Python libraries for machine learning (mainly `pandas` and `scikit-learn`)

Goals

1. *Master the right terms and paradigms* behind AI
1. *Develop (=code) your own (simple) project* based on AI
1. *Make technical considerations* about AI
    - "What happens if I do ...?"
1. *Understanding the surrounding AI world*
    - Make decisions with AI
    - Try to make predictions about AI for your company
    - Orient yourself in an extremely dynamic and complex world dominated by AI

# (Oral) Exam

Questions on **all (theoretical and practical) aspects** of the course

- **Be prepared**: you have to wait 1 month before trying again (in any case)
- Two separate and independent exam sessions (the other w/ Prof. Golfarelli)
  - The final mark is the average of the two exams
- **Interaction** during the lectures/labs is considered in the final evaluation

No scheduled dates, just **book when you are ready**

- *How do you know if you are prepared*?
    - Open random slides and check the titles, can you expose them and make a self-contained speech?
- At least one week in advance, use the [Booking](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/DTMMachineLearningModule@live.unibo.it/bookings/s/VXKOGV3sS02dofzMZtOpHQ2) page

According to the University's regulation

- Exams must be in presence
- Cannot refuse a grade more than once

On the day of the exam (~30 minutes per person):

- 3 questions on different topics about the whole program
- *If you do the final assignment on Machine Learning*, the 1st question is a discussion with slides about your assignment

# Final Assignment (Machine Learning)

You must do an assignment, either on Machine Learning (ask me) or Data Mining (ask Prof. Golfarelli)

The assignment on Machine Learning is about developing (= coding) an AI system (in a group of 2 people, at maximum)

1. Find a problem of your interest
1. Get the data (a public dataset with real data)
1. Define your strategy (algorithms)
1. Describe the insights you extracted from your analysis

**You are responsible for your code** ("I do not know how to program" is not a valid excuse!)

- If you cannot explain your code and your choices...
- ... and/or you copied and pasted it from colleagues or LLMs
- ... you will retake the exam

# Final Assignment (Machine Learning)

Once defined your project:

1. Send me an email to discuss the details of your project
    - ~300 words, including the datasets description, a link to the public dataset, and the main challenges
    - The dataset must require some pre-processing
1. After my approval, register the group (2 people at maximum) and the project here: [https://forms.gle/aZ4L7azCF43qqpzk6](https://forms.gle/aZ4L7azCF43qqpzk6)
1. Now you can start your project on Google Colab

# Final Assignment (Machine Learning)

Once the project is completed:

- Write a 4-page paper about the project. Mandatory points:
    - Use Latex ([https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/))
    - Use this template ([https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/assets/zip/ieeetran-final_sub.zip](https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/assets/zip/ieeetran-final_sub.zip))
    - Sections:
        1. Introduction (~1 page; including group organization and the work done by each member)
        2. Proposed Method (~1.5 pages; what did you do and how)
        3. Results (~1 page; results and insights)
        4. Conclusions (~0.5 pages; summary)
- Upload the paper, assignment, and presentation into a Github repository
    - Presentation must be 10-minute long (no more than 10/12 slides)
    - The assignment must be executable on Google Colab without errors
- Share (with me) the Github repository

**When both members have studied and all the material is ready, both members must book the exam on the same day**

# Teaching material

You will find all you need on Virtuale

- Slides and Python notebooks to be opened on Google Colab

However, **keeping up the pace with machine learning and data mining is hard**

- There is a rapid development of trends and technologies, and not all of them will survive
- Books are easily outdated with respect to cutting-edge services and technologies
- Research papers (often) describe solutions that are not commercial yet
- (IRL) You will need to deal with a lot of (bad) documentation, online articles, etc.

Rule of thumb

- Understand the general concepts and fundamentals
- ... and ask questions!

# Books

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Slides and notes are sufficient to prepare for the final exam

- You can find them on Virtuale platform ([https://virtuale.unibo.it/](https://virtuale.unibo.it/))

However, I suggest you to read the book:

- *Title*: Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow
- *Author*: Aurélien Géron
- Some notes about the book:
    - The book is intended as a support
    - The book is available for free in the library
    - Carefully check the summary and select our topics
    - If you want, you can read the other parts to take inspiration

# Office hours

Lectures start/end 10 minutes later/earlier than the time stated in the teaching calendar

- Please, **arrive on time** to avoid interruptions

Office hours:

- *Short questions*: before/after each lecture
- *Longer questions*: send an email to book an appointment

If you need help for coding and labs, *you can ask me and the designed tutor*

- Remember, "I do not know how to code" is not a valid excuse!
