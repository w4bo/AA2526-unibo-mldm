**CRISP-DM** (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) [@shearer2000crisp]

> A non-proprietary, documented, and freely available data mining model.
>
> Developed by industry leaders with input from more than 200 data mining users [...] and service providers, CRISP-DM is an *industry-, tool-, and application-neutral* model.
>
> This model encourages best practices and offers organizations the structure needed to realize better, faster results from data mining.
>
> CRISP-DM organizes the data mining process into phases [...] that help organizations understand the data mining process and provide a road map to follow while planning and carrying out a data mining project.

**CRISP-DM** breaks down the life cycle of a data mining project into **six phases**:

1. business understanding,
1. data understanding,
1. data preparation,
1. modeling,
1. evaluation,
1. and deployment.

**Arrows**

- indicate the most important and frequent dependencies between the phases
- the outer circle symbolizes the cyclical nature of data mining itself
- ... lessons learned during the data mining process trigger new, often more focused business questions

*We don't do machine learning (only) for the sake of training machine learning models*

- We have real problems to solve and questions to answer
- A data scientist must understand the data and the domain before trying any model
- Machine learning is not a simple copy and paste of code
    - *Code generation can be easily automated and outperform you*!
    - The added value of a data scientist is the understanding of the problem and data
- Data mining/Machine learning is not a course on `scikit-learn`

**Vibe coding** is an AI-assisted software development technique popularized in February 2025.

- A chatbot-based approach to creating software where the developer describes a project or task to a large language model (LLM)
- The LLM generates code based on the prompt.
- The developer does not review or edit the code, but solely uses tools and execution results to evaluate it and asks the LLM for improvements.
- The developer avoids examination of the code, accepts AI-suggested completions without review, and focuses more on iterative experimentation.
