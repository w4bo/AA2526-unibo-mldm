# Business Understanding

(*Perhaps the most important/hard phase of any data mining project* [@shearer2000crisp])

The **business understanding** phase focuses on

1. determine the *business objectives*
2. assessing the *context of the analysis*
3. determining and *translating objectives into data mining goals*
4. producing the *project plan*

This is essential also to understand which data should later be analyzed and how

# Determine the Business Objectives

**Understanding a client's true goal** is critical to uncovering the important factors involved in the project

- Data analysts must uncover the primary business objective as well as the related questions the business would like to address
- Ensure that the project *does not produce the right answers to the wrong questions*
- Beware of *setting unattainable goals*
- Make sure that each *success criterion relates to at least one of the specified business objectives*

> The business goal could be to retain current customers by predicting when they are prone to move to a competitor
>
> - "How does the primary channel (e.g., ATM, branch visit, Internet) of a bank customer affect whether they stay or go?"
> - "Will lower ATM fees significantly reduce the number of high-value customers who leave?"

# Assess the Situation

**Outline the available resources** to accomplish the data mining project, from personnel to software

- *Discover what data is available* to meet the primary business goal
  - Do you have data that's relevant to the question?
    - Do you have measures of the target and features that are related to the target?
    - Do you have an accurate measure of your model target and the features of interest?
  - An existing system might not have the data it needs to address a problem and achieve a project goal
    - Find external data sources or update your systems to collect new data

> To address the business question, a minimum number of customers over age 50 is necessary

- List the *project risks and potential solutions* to those risks
- List the *assumptions* made in the project
- Create a *glossary of business and data mining terms*
  - This is essential in interdisciplinary teams!
- Construct a *cost-benefit analysis* for the project

Things are more complex in a company (*this is the added value of DTM!*)

*Determine the Organizational Structure*

1. Identify key individuals in the organization (also to provide domain expertise)
1. Identify business units that will be affected by the data mining project

*Describe Problem Area*

1. Identify the problem area, such as marketing, customer care, or business development.
1. Describe the problem in general terms
1. Clarify the prerequisites of the project
    - What are the motivations behind the project?
    - Does the business already use data mining?
1. Check on the status of the data mining project within the business group
    - Has the effort been approved, or does data mining need to be "advertised" as a key technology for the business group?
1. If necessary, prepare informational presentations on data mining for your organization

*Describe Current Solution*

1. Describe any solutions currently used to address the business problem
1. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the current solution

# Determine the Data Mining Goals

Formulate **project objectives in business terms**

Ask and refine sharp questions that are relevant, specific, and unambiguous.

- Data science is a process that *uses numbers to answer such questions*
- You typically use data science or machine learning to answer *five types of questions*
    1. How much or how many? (regression)
    1. Which category? (classification)
    1. Which group? (clustering)
    1. Is this unusual? (anomaly detection)
    1. Which option should be taken? (recommendation)

The metrics must be **SMART**:

- *S*pecific
- *M*easurable
- *A*chievable
- *R*elevant
- *T*ime-bound

If the business goal cannot be effectively translated into a data mining goal, *it may be wise to consider redefining the problem*

> Success may be measured by reducing lost customers by 10% or by achieving a better understanding of the customer base
>
> Success should also be defined in these terms such as achieving a certain level of predictive accuracy

# Produce a Project Plan

**Describe the intended plan for achieving the goals**, including:

- outlining specific steps and a proposed timeline
- an assessment of potential risks
- and an initial assessment of the tools and techniques needed to support the project

Generally accepted industry timeline standards are [@shearer2000crisp]:

- 50 to 70 percent of the time and effort in a data mining project involves the *Data Preparation Phase*;
- 20 to 30 percent involves the *Data Understanding Phase*;
- only 10 to 20 percent is spent in each of the *Modeling, Evaluation, and Business Understanding Phases*;
- and 5 to 10 percent is spent in the *Deployment Planning Phase*.

# Special Mention: Interdisciplinarity

Identifying and delving into the problem to solve

- Is an **interdisciplinary** phase
- Even if you have good knowledge in the fields of computer and data science...
- ... maybe you still miss domain knowledge that is fundamental to understanding and modeling the problem
