# A telemetry system for precision agriculture

The impacts of climate change are so rapid that what happened last year is no longer true today.

- We need to act quickly and make decisions based on evidence, not just history.

The brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys) is an insect pest species causing economic damage to several agricultural commodities

- We want to build a data-driven approach to support the application of Integrated Pest Management strategies
- We want to monitor the spread of H. Halys
- And learn the most important environmental factors

Three years-long project

# Cimice.Net

Goal: help farmers protect crops

- A network of monitoring traps has been deployed in Emilia-Romagna
- Monitoring 145, 168, and 101 farms in 2020-2022 (also in 2023 and 2024)

# Collaborative Agro SEnsing

The acquisition of data concerning the installation and monitoring of traps have been aided by *CASE* (*Collaborative Agro SEnsing*)

- Dynamic questionnaire application for on-field data crowdsourcing in the agricultural domain
- Facilitate and standardize the communications between on-field operators with first-hand visuals of a given field/orchard and the technicians needing a 360-degree view of all fields
