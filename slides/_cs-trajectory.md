# Social Habits: La Città Intorno

_Lacittàintorno_ is a programme for urban regeneration promoted by Fondazione Cariplo

- Designed to foster well-being and quality of life in urban areas
- Enhancing the functions and services in place in the following target neighbourhoods: Adriano, Via Padova, Corvetto, and Chiaravalle
- 10 million euros investment over a three-year timeframe

**Question**: what is the profile of users in these neighborhoods?

# Location Intelligence and Mobility Data

::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="75%"}

_More than 80% of companies_ take decisions on the basis of information characterized by a spatial component.

* **Geo-referenced data**: are data that contain a spatial position, they are typically static
* **Trajectory data**: describe objects moving in the environment
* The main providers of trajectory data are:
    * Apps collecting data from GPS
    * Telco that trace connection to Base Transceiver Stations
    * Fleets of trucks, cars and ships
    * …

_Location Intelligence_ is a set of tools that allow  __a geographic dimension__ to be integrated within a  __BI platform__.

- The goal is to increase the  __monitoring ability__ and the capability of understanding  __business events__.
- Location intelligence supports  __data visualization and interaction with maps__ in  __BI contexts__.

# How do you identify relevant places?

::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Personal gazetteer** is a personalized, digital record of significant locations (stay points) to an individual, similar to a geographical fingerprint

- *Staypoints* are places of interest for a user
- How can extract staypoints with the following semantics?
    - *Frequented* places?
    - *Home*?
    - *Work*?

Staypoints vs Trajectories

* **Trajectories** describe mobility behaviors/patterns
  * USE CASE: understand where people going to an event come from?
  * *Frequent trajectories*: an end-to-end cluster of trajectories that are:
    * Compact enough
    * Frequent enough
    * Long enough
* **Staypoints** identify places of interest for a user
    - *Home*: the place where a user frequently stops between 1 and 5
    - *Work*: the place where a user frequently stops between 9 and 17
    - *Attend*: a place where the user stands at least 20 minutes and where at least one commercial activity is situated

# Exploitation of Trajectory Data

::::{.columns}

* **Social habits and behaviors**
  * Identify relevant places
  * Identify communities
* **Urban mobility optimization**
  * Historical analysis of traffic flows
  * Early identification of accidents
  * Dynamic and real-time traffic management
  * Car pooling
- **Mobility/Movement mining** identification of the mode of transport \(car/foot\) along a trajectory
- **Reverse geocoding** it is the process by which an address or the name of a place is associated with a spatial datum \(latitude, longitude\)
- **Layer integration** it is the process by which several information layers are superimposed and interrogated
* **Proximity marketing \(indoor\)**
* … and many others

# Social habits and behaviors: Ubiquitous User Profiling – Reality Mining

Create a **synthetic profile** of the community that transits at a point / place starting  **from anonymous trajectory data**

* _Who are the customers of the shopping center?_
  * 50% live within 5km from the shopping center
  * 20% attend the shopping center X too
  * On Saturday, 20% of customers go to the cinema after being at the shopping center
  * On Saturday, 30% of customers go to restaurant Y after being at the shopping center
* _Who comes on vacation to Cesenatico?_
  * In July 70% of the customers come from Emilia Romagna
  * 27% of customers live in neighborhoods with an average income above 30K €
  * In August, 25% of customers come from Milan
  * 40% of the tourists have children
* _How do the people who use the _  _Freccia_  _ Rossa Milan-Rome behave?_
  * 30%, once in Rome, moves less than 10km from the station
  * 20%, once in Rome, take the subway

# Urban mobility optimization: traffic flows

**Flow**: is defined by a sequence of overlapping trajectories that are not necessarily end-to-end compact
