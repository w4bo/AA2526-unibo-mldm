The increased use of pesticides and fertilizers damages the environment, destroys non-target plants and beneficial insects for the soil and harms human and animal health. Most seeds develop herbicide-resistant properties, rendering pesticides ineffective. Mechanical automatic systems that are studied as alternatives to pesticides deteriorate soil features, damage beneficial soil organisms and offer limited results for in-row weeding. The EU-funded WeLASER project will develop a non-chemical solution for weed management based on pioneering technology consisting of the application of lethal doses of energy on the weed meristems through a high-power laser source. An AI-vision system separates crops from weeds, identifying the weed meristems and pointing the laser at them. A smart controller based on IoT and cloud computing techniques coordinates the system, which is transferred all over the field by an autonomous vehicle.
